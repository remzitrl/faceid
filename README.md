In the project I developed, I integrated facial recognition technology to enhance the security features of the phone. This enables the unlocking of the phone using facial recognition, similar to features like Face ID. As an additional security measure, I also added an option for the user to enter a personalized 4-digit passcode.

Furthermore, I took my project beyond a solely security-focused approach by introducing entertaining features. I incorporated additional functions to the flash and camera icons on the phone's home screen. Clicking on the flash icon activates the phone's flash in a manner visible to the user. Clicking on the camera icon opens the camera tab, allowing the user to see their own face if the device is equipped with a camera. As a result, the project not only revolves around security but also offers an interactive and enjoyable experience for the user.

I didn't focus much on design because the primary emphasis is on facial recognition technology and security. I didn't prioritize HTML and CSS aspects, as the fundamental goal of the project is to highlight facial recognition features, with minimal attention given to responsive design elements.
